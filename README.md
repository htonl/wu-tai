# Wu-tai
An simple application to analyze the network traffic leaving your machine. The goal of Wu-tai is to help you understand which applications are sending which data to which parties. Basically, it allows you to "track the trackers". I understand there are many traffic analyzers available; the purpose of another is a simple UI driven experience for users of all experience levels to become more aware of their internet traffic footprint, and for them to see who is tracking them.
